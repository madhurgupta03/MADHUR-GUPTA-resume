        \item \textbf{Responsibility:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Independently managed entire \textbf{build} and \textbf{assembly} \textbf{pipelines} for various products including \textbf{Creative Cloud Desktop} Family of products consisting of more than \textbf{50+ repositories}. Pipelines included \textbf{nightly}, \textbf{incremental}, on-demand as well as \textbf{Pull request} builds. Ensuring these pipelines are up-to-date with industry standards and available at all times with the best possible \textbf{performance} on the provided resources. Managed various releases, hot fixes, and patches for assigned products with regular monitoring. Creating installers for different Operating Systems, Mobile Apps and \textbf{Docker/Kubernetes}-based services for both \textbf{metal} and \textbf{cloud}.
            \item Automated and refactored 50+ components for Creative Cloud Desktop and partner teams.
            \item Mentored multiple Junior Members of the team.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Achievements:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reduced deliverable time by 50\% to 70\%.} Distributed build and efficient pipeline.
            \item \textbf{Automated more than 80\% of manual work.} Removed error-prone processes and manual intervention.
            \item \textbf{Improved build system reliability.} Continuous monitoring and fixes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Flyover:} Designed and developed a \textbf{dynamic} \textbf{JSON}-like configuration-driven pipeline writing library with \textbf{Groovy/Java} for \textbf{Jenkins}, making pipeline development as easy as writing \textbf{JSON}. Completely rethought and \textbf{Object-oriented} providing smaller, reusable, testable components and integration harness. Flyover is now the preferred library for the Jenkins pipeline by multiple teams with or without any automation background.
        \item \textbf{Release Engineering Support System:} Designed and developed a generic config driver build system written in \textbf{JavaScript} and \textbf{NodeJs} for CI/CD pipelines and migrated all the responsible repos to RESS. Packaged these as \textbf{Grunt plugins} and distributed as \textbf{npm} packages via private \textbf{Artifactory}.
        \item \textbf{PodCast:} Dynamic agent for \textbf{Jenkins}. \textbf{Cloud-ready} solution for modern build pipeline using \textbf{Kubernetes}. Providing \textbf{horizontal scaling} of agents, containerized builds, bundled environment and guaranteed reproducibility of builds. More efficient packing of pipeline resulting in more throughput.
        \item \textbf{Ansible:} \textbf{Infrastructure as Code} (IaC) and \textbf{Configuration as Code} (CaC). Automating infrastructure setup for Linux, macOS and Windows hosts.
        \item \textbf{Virtualization:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implemented \textbf{Openstack} Virtual machines for quick creation and infrastructure setup with volume and snapshots.
            \item POC on \textbf{macOS} virtual machines using QEMU and native virtualization framework solution for Apple silicon. Explored \textbf{OCI} image-based solution for storage and distribution of macOS virtual machines.
        \end{itemize}
