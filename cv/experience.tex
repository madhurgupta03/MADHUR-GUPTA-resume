        \item \textbf{Responsibility:} 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Independently managed entire build assembly pipelines for various products including Creative Cloud Desktop Family of products consisting of more than 50+ repositories. Pipelines included nightly, incremental, on-demand as well as Pull request builds. Ensuring these pipelines are up-to-date with industry standards and available at all times with the best possible performance on the provided resources. Managed various releases, hot fixes, and patches for assigned products with regular monitoring. Creating installers for different Operating Systems, Mobile Apps and Docker/Kubernetes-based services for both metal and cloud.
            \item Automated and refactored 50+ components for Creative Cloud Desktop and partner teams.
            \item Mentored multiple Junior Members of the team.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Achievements:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{Reduced deliverable time by 50\% to 70\%.} Distributed build and efficient pipeline.
            \item \textbf{Automated more than 80\% of manual work.} Removed error-prone processes and manual intervention.
            \item \textbf{Improved build system reliability.} Continuous monitoring and fixes.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Flyover:} Designed and developed a dynamic JSON-like configuration-driven pipeline writing library with Groovy/Java for Jenkins, making pipeline development as easy as writing JSON. Completely rethought and Object-oriented providing smaller, reusable, testable components and integration harness. Flyover is now the preferred library for the Jenkins pipeline by multiple teams with or without any automation background.
        \item \textbf{Release Engineering Support System:} Designed and developed a generic config driver build system written in \textbf{JavaScript} and \textbf{NodeJs} for CI/CD pipelines and migrated all the responsible repos to RESS. Packaged these as grunt plugins and distributed as npm packages via private Artifactory.
        \item \textbf{PodCast:} Dynamic agent for Jenkins. Cloud-ready solution for modern build pipeline using Kubernetes. Providing horizontal scaling of agents, containerized builds, bundled environment and guaranteed reproducibility of builds. More efficient packing of pipeline resulting in more throughput.
        \item \textbf{Ansible:} Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and Configuration as Code (CaC). Automating infrastructure setup for Linux, macOS and Windows hosts.
        \item \textbf{Virtualization:}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Implemented Openstack Virtual machines for quick creation and infrastructure setup with volume and snapshots.
            \item POC on macOS virtual machines using QEMU and native virtualization framework solution for Apple silicon. Explored OCI image-based solution for storage and distribution of macOS virtual machines.
        \end{itemize}
